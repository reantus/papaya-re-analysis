Explanation of variables:


Participant_unique_ID – Indicates participant’s unique code.

correct_keyboard_response – Indicates whether a specific trial was marked as correct (1) or incorrect (0). Incorrectly answered trials were either trials where participants responded incorrectly, or failed to respond within 2 seconds.

correct_response – Indicates what would the correct response for a specific trial be (either button M or C).

flanker_condition – Indicates in which flanker condition the trial was presented. Flanker condition 1 is the unrelated condition with the target word in the middle and the same unrelated word to the target repeated 3 times on each side of the target (bird bird bird wall bird bird bird); in flanker condition 2, target word is repeated in the leftmost flanker position (wall bird bird wall bird bird bird); in flanker condition 3, target word is repeated in the middle left flanker position (bird wall bird wall bird bird bird). The other conditions follow the same logic – in the last flanker condition (7), target word is repeated in the rightmost flanker position (bird bird bird wall bird bird wall).
response_keyboard_response_1 – Indicates which button participant pressed (m or c) for each trial.

response_time_keyboard_response – Indicate response time in ms. Note that initially, response time only included the time that participant needed to respond (without 150 ms of stimulus presentation time). In our dataset, additional 150 ms are already added to all response times.

stimulus - Indicates the stimulus that was presented to participant on each trial.

Latin_square_group – Participants were given a specific number based on which counterbalancing was performed. Latin_square_group indicates that number.

target_type – Indicates whether participant was presented with a word or a nonword for each trial.
